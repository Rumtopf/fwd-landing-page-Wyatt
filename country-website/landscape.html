    <h2>Landscaping</h2>
    <p> landscaping on an acre of land which was mostly a hill was a consistent challenge against nature.
        large trees provided a lot of shady area's. so gardnening had to happen around where the sun would peak through
        The home itself was built on black granite rock that was blasted and duumped all over the yard, parts of which you will see in the gallery pictures.

    <h3>The Coy Pond!</h3>
    <p>
        the pond, nestled between the house and garage, was built into the old driveway with pickaxe, shovel wheelbarrow amd a just a little bit of hardwork.
        the proccess took a few months but as you can see what we got out of it was well worth it!

    <h3>The Rockery!</h3>
    <p>
        the rockery or rockeries we had were an upper rockery and a lower rockery. I moved most of those rocks by hand my self. 
        Black granite is a really dense rock and is quite heavy
        Some of the bigger rocks that I moved around the property were around 300-450lbs yes these were moved by hand. 
        Only moving them via wheelbarrow when they neeed to be moved across the yard.

    <h3>The Gardening</h3>
    <p>
        Gardening had become a staple around my house, when my sibling and I were younger, our mother would alway encourage/ guilt trip us into helping her with the gardening.
        when I got older I really started to enjoy gardening and landscaping building things like rockeries, ponds and cultivating the land.
        Due to the natural shady area gardening was a challenge though we always ha tomatoes, potatoes, and carrots that were usually to small to eat.
