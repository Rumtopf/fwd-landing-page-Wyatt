    <h1>My name is <em>Wyatt Spratt</em></h1> 
        
        <p>I am a student at BCIT, in the Front End Web Developer progam. I have been interested in web design and site content creation since my early highschool years over 25 years ago, the internet was a much different place than it is today. One of my first projects was creating a youth website for the community of Maple Ridge, British Columbia, I don't remember much of what we did to build it as it was over 25 years ago. I'm currently 44 years old and have had many jobs over my career including, Computer Technician, Photographer, pest control Technician, VR help desk Technician, Sr. Trainer, and Sr. Quality Evaluator.
